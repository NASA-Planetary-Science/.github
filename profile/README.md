# NASA-Planetary-Science GitHub 

The NASA Planetary Science GitHub is the recommended repository for software developed through research projects funded by NASA's Planetary Science Division (PSD) within its Science Mission Directorate (SMD), especially research projects under [ROSES](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations) Appendix C.1.

## For access:
Contact Dr. Megan Ansdell at megan.c.ansdell@nasa.gov to request access, which provides researchers with the ability to create a repository for their software.

## Requirements & Resources

The [SMD Scientific Information Policy (SPD-41A)](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SMD-information-policy-SPD-41a.pdf) describes how research software developed with SMD funding must be shared, starting in [ROSES](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations)  2023. In particular, SMD-funded scientifically useful software must: 
- be made publicly available (e.g., via this [NASA Planetary Science GitHub](https://github.com/NASA-Planetary-Science)) no later than the publication date
- be made citable using a persistent identifier (e.g., via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), which is [integrated with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content))
- include a code of conduct and guidelines for community contributions (e.g., as for [NASA TOPS](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))

Additionally, such software is strongly recommended to be released under a permissive license (e.g., [Apache License 2.0](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/), [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/)). The above requirements do not apply to restricted or commercial software.

See the [SMD Open Science Guidelines](https://github.com/nasa/smd-open-science-guidelines/tree/main/OSS_Guidance), in particular the [Software Management & Sharing](https://github.com/nasa/smd-open-science-guidelines/blob/main/OSS_Guidance/Software_Management_Sharing.md) section, for further details and examples of what is considered acceptable compliance to these requirements.
