# NASA-Planetary-Science GitHub 

The NASA Planetary Science GitHub is the recommended repository for software developed through research projects funded by NASA's Planetary Science Division (PSD) within its Science Mission Directorate (SMD), especially research projects under [ROSES](https://science.nasa.gov/researchers/sara/grant-solicitations) Appendix C.1.

## For access:
Contact Dr. Megan Ansdell at megan.c.ansdell@nasa.gov to request access.

## Requirements & Resources

The [SMD Scientific Information Policy, SPD-41A](https://science.nasa.gov/science-red/s3fs-public/atoms/files/SMD-information-policy-SPD-41a.pdf) describes how software developed with SMD funding must be shared. In particular, SMD-funded scientifically useful software that is not restricted must be: 
- made publicly available (e.g., via this [NASA Planetary Science GitHub](https://github.com/NASA-Planetary-Science))
- released under a permissive license (e.g., [Apache License 2.0](https://opensource.org/license/apache-2-0/), [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit/))
- citable using a persistent identifier (e.g., via [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/), which is [integrated with GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/archiving-a-github-repository/referencing-and-citing-content))
- established with a code of conduct and guidelines for community contributions (e.g., as for [TOPS](https://github.com/nasa/Transform-to-Open-Science/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md))

See the [SMD Open Science Guidelines](https://github.com/nasa/smd-open-science-guidelines/tree/main/OSS_Guidance), in particular the [Software Management & Sharing](https://github.com/nasa/smd-open-science-guidelines/blob/main/OSS_Guidance/Software_Management_Sharing.md) section, for further details and examples of what is considered acceptable compliance to these requirements.
